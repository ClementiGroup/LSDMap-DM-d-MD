[LSDMap/example/]
--------------------------
aladip.gro.tar.gz:
  An example data set of alanine dipeptide from GROMACS.


** Compile the program

-If you are using servers in Rice Univerisity, such as
    DAVinCi with openmpi/1.4.4-intel, 
    BIOU with openmpi/1.4.3-ibm,
    and STIC with openmpi/1.3.3-pgi, 
    follow the steps below:
 1. Copy the libraries from toscana:~wz7/git.program/lib to $(HOME)/lib.
 2. Load openmpi module with correct version according to the server listed above.
 3. Run 'configure.sh'.

-If you are not using the servers listed above, please change LSDMap.inc according 
 to your compilers and the path of the required libraries, PARPACK, ARPACK, LAPACK and BLAS.
 PARPACK and ARPACK can be downloaded in www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/.
 LAPACK and BLAS are included in many packages, such as MKL for intel compilers, 
 ESSL for IBM compilers and ACML for AMD platform, or you can always download and 
 compile your own version from www.netlib.org/lapack and www.netlib.org/blas.


** How to proceed Weighted LSDMap
   We will show how to proceed LSDMap on the example data set in directory 'example/'.   
 
1. Prepare the data set to the accepted format for LSDMap.
   -Decompress the example data from 'example/aladip.gro' to the program directory.
	> tar -xvf example/aladip.gro.tar.gz
   -Run script gro2xyz.sh to convert the gromacs .gro file to the format for the 
    LSDMap program, and put the data file in working directory:
	> ./gro2xyz.sh aladip.gro 1
    The .xyz file format is used in LSDMap programs. The format is:

    | first line: <number of points> <number of dimensions>                             |
    | starting from the second line: <the atomic (xyz) coordinates for the first point> |
    |                               <the atomic (xyz) coordinates for the second point> |
    |						...                                     |
    |                               <the atomic (xyz) coordinates for the last point>   |

2. Set the parameters in file 'run_parameters' according to the comments.
    This was tested for HECToR (www.hector.ac.uk).
   -For the example data, leave all parameters as in default EXCEPT:
   	total number of MPI tasks:    mppwidth=
    	number of core per nodes:     mppnppn=
    	wall time:                    maximum wall clock time required for job
    	your budget name:             budget to be charged to (contact project PI
    	                               if unknown)
    -Run 'prepare_p_lsdmap.sh' to prepare the input file.
    	 > ./prepare_p_lsdmap.sh
    -Submit the pbs script:
        > ./submitlist

3. There is one input file needed, an example one is 'ExampleInputFile'. It
    is created automatically by running prepare_p_lsdmap.sh as described
    above. The entries are

    in file	           variable name in code
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    .true. .true. .true.   write_rmsd write_neighbor write_localscale	 
    aladip.xyz      	   nn_traj
    1  10000        	   ns      ne
    3000            	   Nneigh
    1000            	   norder
    1500 30 15      	   dmds    kmin    dk
    0.0 0.01 0      	   seps    deps    neps
    1               	   ncore
    0 1             	   status_dmap     status_eps
    weight.dat      	   NN_input_weight
    aladip.xyz_dif  	   output_file
    0.0             	   cutoff
    18              	   column_eps

4. Run LSDMap
    - Submit the pbs script 'ExampleBatchScript.pbs' for LSDMap.
         > qsub ExampleBatchScript.pbs 
      as described in 2b. via ./submitlist

5. Results:
   <trajectory file name>_dif.eg 
     (eigenvalues in reverse order, that is, 9th, 8th, 7th, ..., 1st, 0th)
   <trajectory file name>_dif.ev 
     (eigenvectors, the first column corresponds to the 0th eigenvalue, 
      the second cooresponds to the 1st eigenvalue, ...)
   <trajectory file name>_eps 
     (local scale from different cutoffs, columns are in the order of 
      <point ID>, <neighbor ID at the local scale with cutoff1>, 
      <local scale with cutoff1>,
      <gap between the first and second eigenvalues with cutoff1>, 
      <intrinsic dimension from the spectra gap with cutoff1>,
      <intrinsic dimension from checking the noise spectra with cutoff1>, 
      <neighbor ID at the local scale with cutoff2>, 
      <local scale with cutoff2>, ...)
   -If everything works fine, you can view aladip.xyz_dif.eg and get the 
    following list of eigenvalues:
    0.167848  0.178829  0.233711  0.267388  0.341161
    0.452993  0.528263  0.697209  0.979835  1.000000
    Note: Small difference in the eigenvalue spectra is possible because random 
    projection multidimensional scaling is used.

** How to embed new points to the diffusion map space

1. Set the parameters in file 'run_parameters' according to the comments

2. Calculate the embedding coordinates.
   -Run 'prepare_embed.sh' to prepare the input files.
   -Run './split_rmsd < split_rmsd.input' to split rmsd files so as 
    to match the number of CPUs to use.
   -Submit the pbs script 'wlsdmap_embed.pbs'.

3. Results:
   <trajectory file name>_dif_embed.ev (eigenvectors for the new points)
   embed/<trajectory file name>_dif_<90000+<loop id>>.eg	 
   embed/<trajectory file name>_dif_<90000+<loop id>>.ev
   (the eigenvalues and eigenvectors in each loop)

Note:
   The number of points to add for one loop is related to the errors 
   or distortions to the diffusion map space.  Usually, the number of 
   points to add for one loop should be smaller than 0.01 times the 
   number of points in the old data set.  The total number of points 
   to add should be divisible by the number of points to add for one loop.
